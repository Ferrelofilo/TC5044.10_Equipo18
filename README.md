# MLOps

This repository is designed to centralize all materials related to our MLOps course. It will serve as a comprehensive resource, including course files, scripts, datasets, and project implementations that cover key concepts in machine learning operations (MLOps). The repository will be structured to facilitate easy navigation and collaboration, making it a go-to location for anyone involved in the course.

## Description

The repository will host all course materials related to MLOps, ensuring a well-organized and accessible platform for collaboration and learning. Within this repository, you will find folders categorized by topics such as CI/CD for ML models, automated testing, model versioning, deployment strategies, and infrastructure automation. Each folder will contain Python scripts, Docker configurations, and any necessary YAML files for orchestration tools like Kubernetes. The repository will also host datasets for practical exercises, as well as detailed documentation for each project and its associated steps. We aim to implement best practices such as proper version control, issue tracking, and collaboration through GitHub features like pull requests and discussions, creating an environment that simulates a real-world MLOps workflow.
